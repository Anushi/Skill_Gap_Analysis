# 🧠 Skill Gap Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs a **data-driven Skill Gap Analysis** by comparing job description skill requirements with candidate profiles. By analyzing Excel-based structured data using Python, it identifies skill mismatches, ranks top gaps, and generates actionable insights for HR departments, educational platforms, and workforce development initiatives.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract and preprocess skills from job postings and candidate resumes.
- Perform comparison logic to identify skill gaps.
- Rank candidates based on gap severity.
- Export filtered outputs for HR or training teams.
